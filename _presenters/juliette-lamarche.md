I am a fullstack developer with a formal training in mathematics and linguistics. I also write poetry. I love functional programming, which I try to make palatable to non FP programmers. As a former analyst, I am sensitive to business perspectives, making sure technical solutions are also creating business value. Finally, poetry and linguistics are giving me insights on what makes a code easier to understand.
