Finite state machine is a formalism which helps model an application logic in a way that is expressive of domain knowledge. xState has popularized the concept in the JavaScript ecosystem. Taking a little distance from the famous library, we will revisit the foundations and see how we can apply the pattern, taking inspiration from functional programming. We will see how state machines solve common programming problems with maintainable code.
